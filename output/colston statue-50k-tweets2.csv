A lot of Bristol's wealth was made through the slave trade and his statue, shown to the left in this photo, is still in Bristol city centre. Lots of bits of Bristol are named after him. ",0,KGravil,

Can somebody in Bristol put a dustbin on his head please ? #Bristol",4,pureevilgallery,

As recently as 2015 the Bishop of Bristol claimed Colston's slave trade links were ""speculation"". They aren't. His involvement is recorded in ledgers.",0,bristol_citizen,

11,2020-06-06 10:09:39+00:00,Moving a statue doesn't erase history. It's the work done by local historians that's put attention on the statue and exposed Colston's true role in the slave trade that was being obscured by the great and good.,0,bristol_citizen,

15,2020-06-06 09:30:48+00:00,"I understand your point but to me that's ""dead"" history. Just another exhibit, more exciting things in the next hall would surely mean it gets forgotten. If the statue hadn't been where it is now I for 1 wouldn't have found out so much about Colston. Why is a statue in a public",0,garybrimson,
16,2020-06-06 08:29:51+00:00,"From what I've read, the statue was largely the project of one man - JW Arrowsmith 170 yrs after Colston's death. It, along with the Victorian myth that surrounds Colston have little historical merit so moving it to a museum as part of the wider slavery story would be appropriate",1,davidelder_uk,
17,2020-06-06 06:36:29+00:00,We should not be celebrating a slave trader. Colston’s statue should be removed and put in a museum where his significance can be properly contextualised. It’s not erasing history. It’s 2020 and we can do better than commemorating someone like this. ,0,_danalogue,
18,2020-06-06 05:45:50+00:00,"What I never realised is that Colston's family left Bristol for London when he was a child and he didn't return to live in Bristol. And yet, through financial acts, he's held as a pivotal Bristolian figure. A statue, music venue, streets, schools and more named after him.",0,adamgasson,
