2989,2020-06-12 00:20:53+00:00, Lord Mandelson! Jungle is as jungle does. The savage beasts responsible for this outrage to the memory of Edward Colston should join his statue at the bottom of the sea with a millstone around their necks. #BlackLivesMatter,Civitas2008,

2991,2020-06-12 00:18:50+00:00,Colston's statue commemorates philanthropist in the same way that Mandela's commemorates South Africa's first black president &amp; an end to apartheid. No one is hiding their true history but that is not what is being celebrated. Want a saint? Go to a church.,Peitho70,

3001,2020-06-12 00:02:36+00:00,I think the only real chance of getting the words changed is if the whole statue is moved. Take the Colston statue in Bristol UK; there's been debate for years (decades?) over what the words should be changed to. Taking it down (by legal means or otherwise) was the only option.,TiklishHoneyBee,
