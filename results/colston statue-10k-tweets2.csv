3,2020-05-30 11:50:04+00:00,"We do airbrush it out. That's literally what we do now. There's no mention of him being a slave trader on his statue, nothing about it in Colston hall. The most we've got is a tiny exhibition tucked away in a dark room in the M-Shed. Take the statue down, rename the hall.",OmegaJak,

8,2020-05-23 08:46:48+00:00,I agree about Auschwitz and that place is about bearing witness to the horror. Colston’s statue commemorates his achievements. They don’t evoke or even bother trying to evoke the same sensations.,stillawake,
9,2020-05-23 08:41:48+00:00,I'd go further. Why hasn't Colston's statue been melted down and recast as a memorial to the victims of slavery?,wood5y,
10,2020-05-23 08:35:57+00:00,I wonder if those still associated with Colston will be. Why is that statue not in a museum and hidden away? ,stillawake,

18,2020-02-03 17:29:38+00:00,I was thinking more of a museum space than a piece of public sculpture. Colston might have a bit more context if there was a museum of the slave trade near his statue in Bristol centre,guybaily,
