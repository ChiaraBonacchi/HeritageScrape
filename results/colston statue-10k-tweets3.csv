Also perhaps a statue to commemorate the people who were trafficked at his behest?",Knightcider,

I don't need that, & in the same way I don't have a need to be concerned about a statue of Churchill or indeed Edward Colston.

11,2020-06-04 21:10:18+00:00,"One example I can think of - having spent 3 years living in Bristol, absolutely astounded that it still stands, is the statue of Slaver Edward Colston, who was directly responsible and profited handsomely from the transatlantic slave trade",camscheijde,
